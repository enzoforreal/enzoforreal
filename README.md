This project will aim to bring together communities of players who will have the opportunity to compete online from their game consoles on their favorite e-sports games (fifa ,tennis,hockey NHL ,NBA2K 
A platform that will connect every opponent who wants to challenge themselves.
Players will be able to exchange via a public and private chat game to search for an available opponent.
At the end of each match the players will have to report their results on the site to close their games and make themselves available again for their future potential opponent.
there will be a top ranking of the best that will be visible to everyone to make our site more attractive.
In order to avoid any cheating there will be a system of disputes (temporary blocking or banning as the case may be).
